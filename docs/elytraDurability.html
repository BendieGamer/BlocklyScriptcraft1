<h1>Elytra Durability</h1>
As an elytra is used, it wears out, and its durability increases.  Also if the player takes damage while flying, the elytra also takes damage.<br>
This code will check the durability of a worn elytra and notify the user if it is too damaged to fly<br>
A durability value above 400 indicates that the elytra is no longer able to fly<br>
