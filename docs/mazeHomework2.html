<H1>Update to your locked maze</h1>
Note: Perform an update as described <a href="https://paulware.github.io/BlocklyScriptcraft/updateBlocklyCode.html">here</a> before attempting this homework (thanks).

This exercise is an extension of the topic discussed in class: <a href="dropMethods.html">Drop Methods </a><br>
<h2>Assignment</h2>
  Apply each of the drop methods in your maze to create custom items<br>
  Some of the drop methods can be used to make custom keys, and other drop methods can be used to craft items<br>
  For example, when a player moves through a doorway you can drop material necessary to craft a recipe for a custom sword or boots<br>
  In the future we will use custom armor to get over obstacles (such as water infested with dangerous fish)<br>
