<H1>Maze Enhancement, Automatically close the door</h1>
Since there may be multiple players in the maze, it would be nice to close/lock the door after it has been opened by 
a player with the correct key<br>
In World, Blocks, Door there is a block that will allow you to close the door<br>
Adding this code where you send the Welcome message will automatically close the door after 5 seconds<br>

To test this code open the door and wait 5 seconds, it should close automatically<br>
Note: You can change the timeout to a different value, but you should at least give the player a few seconds to get through the door<br>
