<h1>Checking the off hand</h1>

Since a right click in the air will not generate an event if there is nothing in the off-hand<br>
We should check the off-hand before launching the player into the air<br>
There is now a block in Entities,Player which will allow you to get the stack that is in the off-hand<br>
Modify your code to check the off-hand before launching the player into the air (on a left click)<br>
You can use this code snippet as a guide<br>
