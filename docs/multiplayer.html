<h1>How to play with others on the local (home) network</h1>
  To allow others on your local home network to play on your server, we first need to find out the local ip address of your server computer<br>
  To determine ip address: cntl-r, cmd, ipconfig<br>

  Look for a 192.168.0.X address which is common<br>
  This is the local ip address of the computer you are running the server on<br>
  The other player will then enter this address: <br>
  From the game select Multiplayer, Direct Connect and then type in the address, and then Join Server <br>
