<H1>Recipe and special effect</h1>
Note: Before trying this homework, you should perform an update as described: <a href="updateBlocklyCode.html">here</a><br>
<ul>
<li>We will start by creating a recipe for a special</li>
<li>We will give it a custom name</li>
<li>We will check to see if it is inhand when the player clicks</li>
<li><i>Extra Credit:</i> Create a kill-aura effect when it is in hand and clicked</li>
</ul>
<h2>Starting recipe</h2>
Here is an example starting recipe, you can use your imagination to change the ingredients<br>
<img src="images/exampleRecipe.jpg"><br>
After you have created this recipe, download the code, /reload, /js test() and confirm that the code behaves the way you expect<br>
You should be able to craft the item at a crafting table<br>
<h2>Add a custom name</h2>
From Items, Stack, insert the <b>Set name to: Custom Name</b> between Result Stack and Stack of 1, then change the Custom Name to "Destroyer" or some other name of your choosing<br>
<b>Note: You must have the double quotes for the code to work properly.</b><br> 
After you have inserted this, download the code, /reload, /js test() and check the behavior.<br>
When you craft the item the custom name should appear when it is in your hand<br>
<h3>Add a player click check</h3>
From World, Events, Add a <b>Listener Event</b> below the recipe and change the event to Player Mouse Click<br>
From Scriptcraft Coding, Variables, add a <b>Set Name =</b>, and change name to player<br>
From World, Events, connect an <b>Event Information</b> to the Set player =<br>  
Change the Event Information from all affected entities to: <b>player</b><br>
From Scriptcraft Coding, Variables, add a <b>Set Name =</b>, and change name to inhand<br>
From Items, Stack, Connect the <b>Custom Name of Stack</b> to the Set inhand =<br>
From Entities, Player, Connect the <b>Stack in hand of Player</b> to the Custom name of Stack<br>
From Scriptcraft Coding, Variables, connect <b>variable:name</b> to the Stack in hand of Player<br>
From Output drag a SendMessage inside the listener Event, below the Set inhand = block<br>
Change the message from "Hello" to <b>"Inhand: " + inhand</b><br>
From Scriptcraft Coding, Variables, connect <b>variable:name</b> to the SendMessage and change name to player<br>
Download the code, /reload, /js test() and check the behavior.<br>
When you have the special sword in hand and click the mouse you should get a message <br>
