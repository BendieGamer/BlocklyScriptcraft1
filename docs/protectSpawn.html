<h1>Protect Spawn Points from explosive damage</h1>
Players will accidentally try to explode spawn points and signs<br>
Since an explosion is not considered a block break, another method needs to be used to protect these locations<br>
This code will check when a projectile hit event occurs, if it occurs near a spawn point<br>
