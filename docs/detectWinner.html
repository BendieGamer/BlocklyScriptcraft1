<H1>Detect Winner</h1>

When a player dies, count the number of active teams.  When there is only 1 team left, that team has won.<br> 
Kick all players and send them a message congratulating the team that won<br>
Also, reset gameId variable so the game will reset when the next player rejoins the server.<br>
