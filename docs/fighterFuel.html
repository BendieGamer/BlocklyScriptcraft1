<h1>Fighter Fuel</h1>
Since the fighter class needs arrows in their off-hand to shoot into the air<br>
Let's rename the arrows as fuel and give the player arrows with a custom name of fuel<br>
<br>
First let's determine where in the code we need to make the change<br>
There is a place in the code where the player is choosing a career, at this point when they choose fighter they should get the fuel<br>
Take a look at the player mouse click event this is where the code change needs to be made<br>

After the code that gets the career, if the career is fighter, we want to give them a custom named stack: <br>
You can use this code as reference:<br>

Can you see how to give the bomber snowballs named "Bombs"?<br>

To decrement the stack, and get the length and type of the off-hand stack consider this code: <br>

Can you visualize how to add a fuel for fighters which is decremented each time the press left mouse to accelerate?<br>
