Plugins are easier to create and more player-friendly than mods.  Plugins are also installed only on the server, which makes them easier to manage.<br>

Some popular plugins you may already be aware of are: <b>Essentials</b>, <b>Grief Prevention</b>, and <b>World Edit</b>. <br>

We will also discuss how to install your game on a public (paid) server.
