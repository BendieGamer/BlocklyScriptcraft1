<h1>Introduction</h1>
Have you ever wanted to create your own minecraft game and run it on a public server?  This class will teach you step-by-step how to do that.<p>

We will create 3 plugins which completely describe the behavior of 3 different games: 
<ul>
  <li>Spleef</li>
  <li>Omaha Beach</li>
  <li>Tower Defense</li>
</ul>
Plugins are easier to create and more player-friendly than mods.  Plugins are also installed only on the server, which makes them easier to manage.<br>
Typically mods are run off Forge on the client-side and the player needs to install them.  The server will kick a player if it doesn't like their list of installed mods: <br>

Mods are also more difficult to create as they are written in java and use eclipse.  The plugins we create will be done in javascript using a scratch-like program I wrote called Blockly-Scriptcraft.  It looks like this:<p>

Some popular plugins you may already be aware of are: Essentials, Grief Prevention, and World Edit. <br>

This course consists of 24: 1 hour classes, 8 classes per game.   We will create code in scratch and test the code in a minecraft server running on your own personal computer, so the first step is getting this free server installed on your own machine.<br>
We will also discuss how to install your game on a public (paid) server, and at that end of each class you will be given access to a game on a public server that demonstrates the code we discussed in class.
