<h1>Give Player Item from a command block</h1>
A common method to give players stacks of items is to execute the command via a command block<br>
<hr>
Before we start though, the server.properties file should be modified:<br>
<ul>
   <li>Stop the server (if it is running)</li>
   <li>Edit the server.properties file and change enable-command-block=false to enable-command-block=true</li>
   <li>Restart the server</li>
</ul>
<hr>
Go to creative mode and give yourself a command block, and place it on the world.<br>

<hr>
Place an oak button on top of the command block (note: use shift-right click)<br>
Alternately, you could also place a lever next to the command block<br>
When you press the button, you should be given an arrow with the custom name of "Fuel"<br>
