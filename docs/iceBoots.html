<H1>Special Maze Challenge, Traverse Lava</h1>
This room will be a room filled with lava<br>
The only way across will be if the player is wearing a special armor boot named "ICE BOOTS"<br>
First we should place a "Beware of Lava" sign next to the door: <br>

Next we need to fill the room with lava when the player is in the doorway<br>
This code will execute a server fill command when the player is at a specific location<br>
