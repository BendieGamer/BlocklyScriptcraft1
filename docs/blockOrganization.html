<h1>Functional Block Organiation</h1>
As you refactor code, and create functions, it's easy to get lost in the forest of functions<br>
The method we will use to organize or functions is top-bottom, using a clock in order of function call<br>
At the very top is the setup code, functions it calls will be arranged in a clock based on order of call<br>
For example the first function the setup code calls will be found at 3 oclock, the next at 6, the next at 9<br>
6 oclock is reserved for those functions that are too large to fit on the clock<br>
These functions will have their own clock, with the first function called at the 3 oclock position<br>
This diagram shows functions with their order of call<br>
