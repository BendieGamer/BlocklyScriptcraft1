<h2>Give a splash potion to player on mouse click</h2>
This first example will give a player a random potion when they click their mouse<br>

<h2>Give a drinkable potion to player on mouse click</h2>
To make it a drinkable potion, just change "Splash Potion" to "Drinkable Potion":<br>

<h2>Name the potion</h2>
It would be good to know what we are drinking, so lets give the potion a name: <br>
We do this by adding a <b>Modify stack set custom name</b> block to the code right before adding it to the player's inventory<br>

<h2>Drop the potion on the ground</h2>
Sometimes we will want to drop the potion rather than giving it to the player directly<br>
To do this Chang the <b>Add stack to inventory for player</b> block to <b>Drop Stack of Items at Location</b>.  For the location use: player.location<br>

<h2>Enchant an arrow with the potion effect</h2>
You may also want to apply a potion effect to an arrow.   To do this we will use a <b>Tipped Arrow</b><br>
To test this you will need to shoot a bunch of arrows straight up, eventually one will hit you<br>

<h2>Combine potion effects</h2>
Rather than using the random potion effect you can add multiple effects together: <br>

<h2>Homework</h2>
Create a potion that gives a player levitation but will not damage the player when it wears off.  Hint: <i>Combine more than 1 potion effect</i>
