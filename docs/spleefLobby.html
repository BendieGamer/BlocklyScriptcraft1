<H1>Spleef Lobby</h1>

Most of the work on a lobby is done in the minecraft world itself<br>
The only plugin work is to hande a click on a sign which will then assign a player to a team and teleport them to the team location<br>
<br>
This code will handle a mouse click and select a team when a team sign is clicked on<br>
