<H1>Homework 1: Set Global Locations</h1>

Create a world and determine 6 locations (using F3) in the world: 
<ul>
<li>Location of red bed</li>
<li>Location of blue bed</li>
<li>Location of red air defense</li>
<li>Location of blue air defense</li>
<li>Location of lobby (where the player will pick a team)</li>
<li>Location of teamLobby (where the player will pick a career)</li>
</ul>

Write these locations down and have them ready to show in the next class, and also your reason for choosing them.<br>
Then create blockly setup code that looks like the diagram; <a href="dataDictionary2.html">dataDictionary2</a> using your locations.<br>
In the next class we will use these locations to spawn in a bed and air defense.  <br>
