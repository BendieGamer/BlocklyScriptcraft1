<H1>Join Server, Respawn</h1>
This code will mark the player for spawn point teleportation they respawn, join the server, or the server is reloaded<br>
It will also call your test function (so you do not need to enter /js test()).  You will however need to run the /reload command<br>

When the player moves this code will check if the player needs to be teleported to the spawn point<br>
