<H1>T Command</h1>
/t command is similar to the whisper command<br>
When a user enters a command such as: /t Hello what is up?<br>
You can use the list from text block with a space as delimeter<br>
You end up with the list: <br>
<ol>
  <li>/t</li>
  <li>Hello</li>
  <li>what</li>
  <li>is</li>
  <li>up?</li>
</ol><br>
Then you can use the get and remove block on the first element and your commmand becomes<br>
/t<br>
And the list becomes:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Hello</li>
  <li>what</li>
  <li>is</li>
  <li>up?</li>
</ol>
<br>
You can then use text from list block to reform the message : <br>
Hello what is up?<br>
Check if the command is /t and you can send the message to the appropriate players within a certain block radius of your player<br>
