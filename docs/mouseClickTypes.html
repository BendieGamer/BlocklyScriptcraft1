<h1>Mouse Click Types</h1>

<b>Note:</b> In Minecraft when you left or right click the mouse, you get <b>2</b> events one from the main hand and one from the off-hand<br>
To make sure that you don't count the click twice, add logic: <br>

There are also 4 types of mouse clicks that can occur:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Left click on air</li>
  <li>Left click on block</li>
  <li>Right click on air</li>
  <li>Right click on block</li>
</ol>
This code will print the type of click in the server console: <br>

You should then see on the server: <br>

To handle the different types of mouse clicks you can make an if-else if structure: <br>

Note: "click on air" does not necessarily mean you are clicking in the sky.  You may be pointed at a block, but the block is out of range to be selected<br>

The last thing you need to know about mouse clicks is that sometimes right clicks do not occur unless you have something in your off-hand<br>
Test out this code: <br>
<img src="images/testHandAction.jpg"><br>
A right click in the air may not trigger an event if nothing is selected<br>
We will need to instruct the player to select an item for a right-click hand combination<br>
  You can place an item in the off-hand by using the 'f' key.<br>
  Also by selecting an item in the hotbar with the mouse wheel will cause a right click to occur in the air<br>
  Left-click does not have any restriction<br>
