<H1>Homework: Special effect when a staff is held</h1>

Imagine that in your game there is a special staff that has a special ability.  We will call it a<br>
<p><b><i>Staff of healing</i></b><p>   
When it is in the players hand, and the player clicks their mouse, it will raise the players health all the way to full (20).<br>

<h2>Coding description</h2>
<pre>
  Inside your function named test (Scriptcraft->Functions)
    When the "Listener Event" Player Mouse Click occurs(World->Events)
      Set the player variable to "Event Information Get Player"(World->Events) 
      When "Material Type in Stack" (Items->Stack) of "Stack in hand of player"(Entities->Player) is a stick 
      "Set Health for Player" (Entities->Player) to 20    


You can test your code by
   1. Running your local service
   2. Execute Minecraft
   3. Muliplayer, direct connect, localhost
   4. Download the code to C:\MinecraftServer\Scriptcraft\Plugins directory
   5. /Reload inside the minecraft game
   6. /js test() inside the minecraft game  
   7. Damage the player (perhaps be jumping off a tall structure)
   8. Give the player a stick using the server command: /give @a stick 1 
   9. Rotate the mouse wheel to place the stick in the players hand
  10. Click the mouse, the health of the player should be restored to full

  This is the code you can show me at the beginning of class. <br>
  During the class we will then give a staff a special name so that you can have different sticks in your game with different powers <br>
