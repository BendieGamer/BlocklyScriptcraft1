<h2>Purchase an item from an oak button</h2>
  In your world add an oak button and a sign above. <br>
  The sign should indicate that the button is used to purchase an item, and the cost of the item<br>

  Next, find the XYZ location of the button.   You can do this by using F3 and note the "Looking At" location.<br>

  If the block clicked on matches the oak button we can purchase the SCUBA for the player<br>
