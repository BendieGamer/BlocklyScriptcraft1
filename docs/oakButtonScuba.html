<H1>Purchase in-game items</h1>
Note: Perform an update as described <a href="https://paulware.github.io/BlocklyScriptcraft/updateBlocklyCode.html">here</a> before attempting this homework (thanks).

This exercise is an extension of the topic discussed in class: <a href="paymentMethods.html">In Game Payment Options</a><br>
<h2>Purchase an item from an oak button</h2>
  In your world add an oak button and a sign above. <br>
  The sign should indicate that the button is used to purchase an item, and the cost of the item<br>

  Next, find the XYZ location of the button.   You can do this by using F3 and note the "Looking At" location.<br>

  Now we can add logic to the Player Mouse Click event to test the block clicked on<br>
  If the block clicked on matches the oak button we can purchase the SCUBA for the player<br>
  You can use this diagram as a reference: <br>
  <img src="images/scubaPurchaseCode.jpg"><br>
  Note: The SCUBA is always placed in the hotbar slot 1.  But this wipes out whatever the player currently has in that slot before the purchase.<br>
  A better solution would be to just add the SCUBA to the player's inventory<br>
  I will look for this block for next class.<br>
  Make sure to add this to your project code, and save the project.<br>
  Thanks!
