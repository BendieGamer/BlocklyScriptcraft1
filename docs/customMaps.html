<H1>Custom Maps</h1>

Adding our own custom art to the world is a nice way to personalize your world.<br>
You can also use them to instruct the player of the rules and give them hints<br>

First give yourself an itemframe and a map<br>
When you right click on the map in your hotbar it will activate the map and give it an id<br>
You can then place the map in the itemframe<br>
You will need a map renderer to display your own custom image<br>

This code will create the map renderer that can display any image.  <br>
The standard image size is 128 x 128 pixels.   If you use that size it will not blur the image<br>
If the image is not size 128 x 128 it will perform a resize which will distort the image<br>
<img src="images/customMaps.jpg"><br>
Rename the .jpg image that you would like to display to match the message in the item frame, and<br> 
place the .jpg image in the scriptcraft/plugins/images directory located in your server folder.
