<H1>Whisper Command</h1>
In your game, the player will not be operators, so they will not be able to issue any server commands<br>
However, you can intercept their commands and execute ones that fit your game<br>
This code will intercept a new command: /whisper and send the server command /say to each player within 5 blocks of the sender<br>
