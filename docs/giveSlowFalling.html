<h1>Give Player slow falling</h1>
When you put a player in the air, it is nice to also give them slow falling so they do not die.<br>
This code will give a player slow falling if they are in the air and click the mouse<br>

To test this code, go into creative mode (/gamemode creative)<br>
and go in the air by pressing the space bar twice quickly, and then once to float<br>
then click the mouse and check the server console.  You should see a message indicating that you are in the air, and slow falling has been applied<br>
Next go to the ground by pressing the space bar twice, and click the mouse<br>
You should see a message in the server console indicating that you are on the ground<br>
