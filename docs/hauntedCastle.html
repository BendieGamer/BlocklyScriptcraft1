The command: <br>
   /js castle ()<br>
will create a castle with 4 towers.   We will create a player-moved listener event which will spawn a mob when the player entires one tower<br>   
Use the F3 built in feature to look at the top ladder block for one of the towers.<br>
Use this [x,y,z] location for the location.x, location.y, and location.z in the following code: <br>
