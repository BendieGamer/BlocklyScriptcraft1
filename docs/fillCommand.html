<H1>Fill command</h1>
The server /fill command is a way to add many blocks to a world quickly<br>
There is however a "flaw" with the command<br>
If you try to initialize a world with the fill command, there is a good chance you will get this error:<br>
<pre>
   That position is not loaded
</pre>
<br>
The issue is that the server fill command only works on world blocks that are currently loaded.<br>
This behavior will not work for us, so I created a "fill" command that spawns blocks in a loop instead:<br>

You add the type of block, location to start and the x,y,z offsets which indicate how width, height, and long you want to fill<br>
