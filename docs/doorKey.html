<H1>Door Key</h1>
Note: Perform an update as described <a href="https://paulware.github.io/BlocklyScriptcraft/updateBlocklyCode.html">here</a> before attempting this homework (thanks).
<hr>
Since minecraft has no keys, some people have used a tripwire-hook as it resembles a key in appearance: <br>

We will make a special tripwire-hook and give it a custom name to allow us to lock doors.

<ul>
   <li>Create a recipe for a tripwire-hook with a custom name: "OAK_KEY"</li>
   <li>When a player opens a door, and the OAK_KEY is not in their hand, cancel the event</li>
   <li>Only cancel the event if the door is not already open (so that can close the door without a key)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Recipe for special OAK_KEY</h2>
<img src="images/oakKeyRecipe.jpg"><br>
Test out your code by seeing if you can craft an "OAK_KEY"<br>
<hr>
<h2>Create a player mouse click listener event to check for "OAK_KEY"</h2>
<img src="images/mouseClickOakKey.jpg"><br>
You can test your code by trying to open an oak door when the key is not in your hand.  The door should remain closed.
<hr>
<h2>Add a check if the door is not open already</h2>
Add another if statement to check if the door is open, before cancelling the event<br>
You can use this complete diagram as a reference: <br>
<img src="images/oakKey.jpg"><br>
You can test your code by trying to close the door when the key is <b>NOT</b> in your hand.  It should close, but not open.

<h2><i>Minecraft Issue: Spawn Protection</i></h2> 
<hr>
The is something called spawn protection which inhibits the opening of doors when they are within 16 blocks of the spawn point.<br>
If you are having trouble opening a door it could also be due to this feature<br>
To disable spawn-protection, edit the server.properties file and change spawn-protection=16 to spawn-protection=0<br>
