<H1>Capture Points</h1>
In the popular Battlefield games, capture points are acquired when a soldier occupies a nearby location<br>
Using code similar to our auto-defender we can acquire capture points for red or blue team members<br>
When they are nearby a "flag" is raised in their color<br>
First we need to spawn a capture point: <br>

Next we will create code similar to the auto-defender to raise the flag<br>
This code will be called by the playerMove event <br>
