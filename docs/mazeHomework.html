<H1>Creating a locked maze</h1>
Note: Perform an update as described <a href="https://paulware.github.io/BlocklyScriptcraft/updateBlocklyCode.html">here</a> before attempting this homework (thanks).

This exercise is an extension of the topic discussed in class: <a href="doorKey.html">OAK KEY </a><br>
<h2>Assignment</h2>
Create a maze or group of connected rooms that have various types of doors, such as birch door, dark oak door, oak door, etc</br>
Create a recipe for different matching door keys as described in the OAK KEY class topic above, or provide an anvil which players can craft their particular keys<br>

Create plugin logic which will cancel a player mouse click on a door unless the player is holding the appropriate key in their hand, <br>
as described in the OAK KEY class topic above.<br>
<h3>Option 1</h3>
Populate your maze with various boss monsters when a player moves through a door.  This behaviour is described: <a href="bossMonster.html">here</a><br>
When the boss monster dies, have them drop a key.<br>
<h3>Option 2</h3>
You can also place various chests in your maze that help the player get through the maze. <br>
These chests can contain the keys that are required.   One advantage of this approach is that the keys will not de-spawn<br>
