In some games, Player Versus Player damage is not allowed<br>
The following code will cancel damage from another player<br>

To test this code, give yourself some arrows and a bow and shoot them into the air. <br>
When they hit you, you are doing damage to yourself.  <br>  
Since you are a player, the damage event should be cancelled.<br>
View the server console, you should see a message: cancel pvp damage<br>
This means that your code is behaving properly.
