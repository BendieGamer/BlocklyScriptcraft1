<H1>Area Effect Clouds</h1>
Note: Perform an update as described <a href="https://paulware.github.io/BlocklyScriptcraft/updateBlocklyCode.html">here</a> before attempting this homework (thanks).

After investigating lingering potions, I found this post online:

I want to make the lingering potion particles last longer after it has been thrown.
 How (if possible) can I do this?

Answer:
 You can't customise the cloud of a lingering potion after it has been thrown, although you can summon custom clouds 
   without the lingering potion using the server command:

/summon minecraft:area_effect_cloud ~ ~ ~ {Radius:5,Duration:10000,Effects:[{Id:5,Amplifier:0,Duration:60}]}

Where the first duration is the time the cloud lasts in ticks, and the second duration is the time the potion effect lasts in ticks.

I thought about this and wondered was an area effect cloud considered a creature?  Could I summon one like 
I would summon a mob?<br>

After further trial and error I added a section in Items named Area Effect Cloud. <br>
In this section you can: 
<ul>
  <li>Add Custom Effect (a potion effect)</li>
  <li>Set the duration of the cloud to exist</li>
  <li>Set the radius of the cloud</li>
</ul>  
<br>

For this homework, create an area effect cloud and change the radius, duration, and effect.   Its pretty cool<br>
You can use this diagram as an example: <br>

<b>Note:</b> It is also possible to set the cloud particle color (default color is black).  Let me know if you would like to try this option.<br>
