<H1>Array Structures</h1>
Welcome to probably the most abstract topic we will discuss.<br>
Sometimes a list by itself is not sufficient.   <br>
For example lets go back to our shopping list of apples, bananas and pears<br>

Maybe you only need a dozen apples, but you need 2 dozen bananas...How would you remember this difference?<br>
You could create another list of just quantities, but for each extra item you needed you would need to create a new list<br>
This is a little cumbersome.   What is needed is a data structure that you house all the data you need for an item.<br>
Then make a single list of the data structures<br>
We have the same issue with control points.   At first we just needed to remember location, now we need location, owner, and how high the flag is currently raised<br>
