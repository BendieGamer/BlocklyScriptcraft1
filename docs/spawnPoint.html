<H1>Set spawn point</h1>

There are 2 server commands that set the spawn point<br>
The world spawn command sets a general location<br>
The setspawn command sets a specific location<br>

When a player joins a server or respawns they are sent to the spawn point. <br>
This should be the location of your lobby.   <br>
These commands should be set when the first serverJoin event is triggered after a server reload.<br>
