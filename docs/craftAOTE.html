<H1>Homework: Craft the AOTE and program its special ability</h1>

Imagine that in your game there is a special sword called the AOTE.<br>
When you you hold the sword in your hand and right or left click, you will be teleported to the block you are looking at<br>
Since this is a very op function, there is a cool-down period.<br>
Below it the code that creates a recipe for AOTE and is missing a block that complete the cool-down function<br>
Change the recipe to include Ender Pearls, and Blaze Rod, and complete the cool-down logic.<br>
Test out your code to make sure it behaves the way you expect.<br>
