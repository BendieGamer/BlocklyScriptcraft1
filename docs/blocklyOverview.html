<h1>Blockly-Scriptcraft Overview</h1>
<img src="images/blocklyScriptcraft.jpg"><br>
<b>Blockly-Scriptcraft</b> will allow you to visually program a minecraft plugin like you would make a scratch program<br>
This program should be run from the chrome browser only.  To open it, double click on the blocklyScriptcraft.html file in the BlocklyScriptcraft directory on your personal computer<br>
On the left side is a menu that can be expanded to show sub-menus.  Here you will find the blocks that you need to create your minigame<br>
<p>
Above the menu is a Search For Block feature that will allow you find any block quickly.   To try this out, type "function" into the Search for Block area.  It should respond with: Function => Scriptcraft Coding, Functions.  
This means that the function block is found under the Scriptcraft Coding Menu, subMenu: Functions
<p>
To the right of the Search For Block feature are 3 tabs: 
<ul>
   <li>Blocks, which shows the current blocks being created</li>
   <li>Javascript, which shows the javascript and allows you to download into the scriptcraft/plugins directory</li>
   <li>Project, which allows you to save and load the current project block definitions</li>
</ul> 
<p>
On the lower right is a trash can.  You can drag blocks into the trash can to delete them.   You can also delete or disable a block by right-clicking on the block and selecting delete or disable<br>
One useful feature is the duplicate block feature.  You can duplicate a block, by right-clicking on the block and selecting duplicate.

<br>
<b>Note:</b> The javascript is automatically created by Blockly-Scriptcraft.  You will not need to manually edit this code.
<p>
After creating your blocks, click on the "Download to SpigotMC/scriptcraft/plugins" button, and save the file as test.js.<br>

The second time you press the "Donwload to SpigotMC/scriptcraft/plugins" button it will try to save to test.js(1) copy.  <br>

<b>Do NOT use this option, it will confuse the server, overwrite test.js instead<br>

  This will place your code in an area that the minecraft server can find<br>
Next, in the server console window, execute the command: reload.  This tells the server to read all the plugins that are available in the scriptcraft/plugins directory. <br>
By aware that sometimes the server will show an error when you issue the reload command.  This is an indicator that there is something wrong with the blocks.<br>
Next run your code by issuing the server command: js test().  This executes the function that you have just created in blockly-scriptcraft.<br>
Also at this time check the server window, sometimes error appear when the test function is executed.  This is another indicator that there is something wrong with the blocks.
