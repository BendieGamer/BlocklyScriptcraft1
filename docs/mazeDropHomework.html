<H1>Update to your locked maze</h1>
Note: Perform an update as described <a href="https://paulware.github.io/BlocklyScriptcraft/updateBlocklyCode.html">here</a> before attempting this homework (thanks).

This exercise is an extension of the topic discussed in class: <a href="dropMethods.html">Drop Methods </a><br>
<h2>Add a precious metal drop to a doorway</h2>
  First step is to give the player a precious metal item when they pass through a doorway. <br>
  You can determine the current location of a player by using F3 and looking at XYZ coordinate: <br>

  Also we will need to add a timer so that the player doesn't get "spammed" with precious metal<br>
  You can use this diagram as an example: <br>
  Note: Location = block will truncate (eliminate) the location.x, location.y and location.z numbers after the decimal point, so just use the integer part of the number. <br>

<h2>Extra Credit</h2>
  <b>Add each of the drop methods defined <a href="dropMethods.html">here</a> to your maze.</b><br>
  Some of the drop methods can be used to make custom keys, and other drop methods can be used to craft items<br>  
  For example, when a player moves through a doorway you can drop material necessary to craft a recipe for a custom sword or boots<br>
  In the future we will use custom armor to get over obstacles (such as water infested with guardians)<br>  
  Perhaps what would be useful would be a random drop of an item rather than always give the same item this could make the maze more challenging<br>
