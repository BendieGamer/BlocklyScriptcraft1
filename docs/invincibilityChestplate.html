<H1>Special Maze Armor, Invincibility Chestplate</h1>
  Imagine that there is an obstacle that is so overpowering (such as a room full of differing mobs),<br>
  that the only way a player can get through the room is to be invulnerable to damage<br>
  That is the purpose of this special armor item.

  When you are wearing this item, you cannot be damaged by fire, water, arrows, players, or mobs<br>
  It is very over powered which is why it must be removed from inventory if worn to complete a challenge.
