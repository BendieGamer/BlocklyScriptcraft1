<H1>Methods for dropping/creating custom items</h1>
This topic will discuss various methods for players to obtain a custom item:<br>
<ul>
<li>Dropped at player's location when a player pushes a specific button</li>
<li>Use an Anvil to give an item a custom name</li>
<li>From a chest</li>
<li>From a recipe</li>
<li>Dropped by a boss monster when killed</li>
<li>Dropped when a player moves over a specific [x,y,z] location</li>
</ul>
<H2>Drop on item on button push</H2>
Add an oak button to your world, and then use F3 to get the location of the button.<br>
Use this information to populate the X,Y,Z location in the if statement: <br>
Note: You do not need to check that an oak button was the type of block clicked on.  In this regard you can also use a sign<br>
You also might want to have some kind of sign to indicate what the button will give you<br>
<i>You could also have a cost for the item, and check how many gold, emerald or diamonds are in their hotbar</i>
