<H1>Maze Enhancement, Mob Protection</h1>
Note: Perform an update as described <a href="https://paulware.github.io/BlocklyScriptcraft/updateBlocklyCode.html">here</a> before attempting this homework (thanks).

Let's say that you have a bunch of creatures in a room, so many that they cannot be defeated<br>
The only way through this obstacle is to become "invisible" to them.<br>
The problem with the invisibility potion effect is that you can still be detected by mobs, just at a lower rate<br>
What we really need is make it so that we cannot be targeted by a mob.  <b>We need to cancel the target entity event</b><br>
This code will do that when the player is wearing a helmet named "INVISO".  This is a very over-powered effect so the helmet should probably be removed when the player leaves the room<br>

You will also need to create mobs when you enter the room.  This is done by code placed in the playerMove event:<br>
The first location is the doorway entrance<br>
The second location is the place in the room where zombies will spawn<br>

Create a room where zombies will spawn.  You might make this room with no ceiling, that way the zombies will eventually die from the sunlight<br>
When you are wearing the inviso helmet, the mob should look at you but not attack.  If that happens the test of the code is successful.
